# Iris-SVM-Classification
Language : Python 
Libraries : Numpy , pandas , matplotlib , sns , sklearn
Algorithm : SVM

We want to classify the iris flowers using their features such as petal width , petal height , sepal width , sepal height.
We utilise the Support vector machine classifier from sklearn to train the dataset by splitting and then applying the trained model on test dataset to classify the flowers into various categories based on their feature set
